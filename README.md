# Nothing interesting here!

This is just for following along with a course. Very little of this code is original. (Though, in the spirit of learning, some of it is.)

What are we trying to do? Scrap the content from http://books.toscrape.com. 

The course itself is on [Udemy](https://www.udemy.com/course/the-complete-python-course).

The accompanying [source repo](https://github.com/tecladocode/complete-python-course) is also on GitHub.

This repo is specifically for the part about web page scraping.

## Setup (macOS)
Clone/fork/pull the repo.

### Create a virtual environment (because Python is broken)
```
python3 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
```

### Install some libraries
```
pip3 install request
pip3 install beautifulsoup4
```
